# Conversations

The Conversations feature provides a clear overview of the history of interactions between users and individual AI assistants within the Siesta AI platform.

## Feature Description

### Overview of All Conversations
An administrator or authorized user can see a list of all previous conversations sorted by date. The overview displays the following information:

- **Date and time the conversation started**
- **Subject / topic of the conversation** (e.g., "Specified deadline for termination of employment")
- **Number of messages in the conversation**
- **Name of the assistant** with whom the communication took place (e.g., "HR Assistant")

### Conversation Detail
Clicking on a row opens the entire chat history, including all inputs and outputs.

### Feedback Option
For each response, you can give positive feedback (thumbs up) or negative feedback (thumbs down), or add a comment. This information is then displayed in the Feedback section and helps fine-tune the accuracy of responses.

### Access Rights
Access to these records is restricted by roles. For example, regular users can only see their own conversations, while administrators or the management team have access to the entire overview.
