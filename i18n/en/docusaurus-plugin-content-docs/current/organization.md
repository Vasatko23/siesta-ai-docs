# Organization

The Organization module allows you to manage entities (e.g., companies) that use the Siesta AI platform. Each organization can group multiple users, manage their access, and set billing information. This module is ideal for companies that need to have an overview and control over who uses the platform, how, and in what role.

## List of Organizations

The main overview displays all existing organizations, including their name and billing address. Each organization has an action available for detailed viewing or editing.

## Creating a New Organization

Clicking the **Add Organization** button opens a form for creating a new organization. The following information is entered here:

- **Name** – name of the organization
- **Country** – country of headquarters
- **Street, Street Number, City, ZIP** – address of headquarters
- **Tax ID, VAT Number** – organization identification details for billing

After filling in all the details, simply click the **Submit** button and the organization will be created.

## Organization Detail

In the organization detail, you can edit the information or delete the organization using the **Delete Organization** option, which is protected by a confirmation checkbox.

## Linking to Roles and Users

Each organization can have users assigned with different roles (e.g., admin, editor, viewer). This way, the platform can be managed across the entire company – users are tied to one organization and can only work with the data, assistants, and settings of their organization.

This approach allows for easy scaling for larger companies or groups, where multiple teams use the platform simultaneously but with different access and permissions.
