# Profile

The Profile section allows users to manage their basic information and change their password. Every logged-in user will find a form here divided into two parts:

## Account Information

At the top of the screen, the user can edit their basic identification information:

- **Name** – the display name of the user within the application.
- **E-mail** – the e-mail address associated with the account (also used for login).
- **Role** – the current assigned role within the platform (e.g., Admin).

Changes are saved by clicking the **Save Changes** button.

## Change Password

At the bottom, it is possible to update the password. The user must enter:

- **current password**,
- **new password**,
- **repeat new password** for confirmation.

Password requirements according to internal policies may be displayed below the form. After filling in all fields, simply click the **Save Changes** button and the changes will take effect immediately.

This section is designed to be simple and clear so that every user can manage their account without unnecessary steps.
