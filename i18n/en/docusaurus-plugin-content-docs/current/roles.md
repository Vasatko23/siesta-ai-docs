# Roles

The Roles section is used to set permissions for individual roles within your organization. Each role defines which application features users can access and how they can interact with them.

## List of Roles

In the overview, you see a list of all existing roles. Each role has its unique ID and name (for example, Admin, User, etc).

Clicking the eye icon next to a specific role takes you to the detailed permission settings.

## Creating or Editing a Role

When creating a new role (the **ADD ROLE** button) or editing an existing one, a form appears where you define:

- **Role name (Name)**
- **Permissions for individual parts of the system** using checkboxes.

Available permissions are divided by module:

- **Assistants** – View / Create / Update / Delete
- **Feedback** – only a single checkbox for access (not further subdivided)
- **Users** – View / Create / Update / Delete
- **Roles** – View / Create / Update / Delete

This way, you can set up, for example, a role that can only view assistants and rate responses, but cannot add anyone or modify user settings.
