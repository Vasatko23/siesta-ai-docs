# Chat

The Chat section is used for conducting conversations with AI assistants that are created and configured in the Assistants section of the platform. Here, users can start new conversations, browse the history of previous chats, and provide feedback on responses.

## Starting a New Conversation

A new chat is started using the **New Chat** button. After clicking it, a modal window appears where the user:

- enters the name of the conversation,
- selects the assistant to communicate with (from the list of previously created assistants),
- optionally can go directly to create a new assistant.

By confirming the selection with the **Submit** button, the chat is initialized and the main conversation interface opens for the user.

## Chat Interface

The main screen is divided into two parts:

- **on the left** is the history of all conversations (including name and date),
- **on the right** is the actual communication with the selected assistant.

The user types their questions into the input field at the bottom of the screen and sends them by pressing the **Send** button. There is also an option to activate voice input or attach an additional file.

The assistant responds in real time, and each message remains stored within the given conversation.

## Feedback on Responses

Under each assistant's response, you can click the thumbs up or thumbs down icon, allowing the user to quickly provide feedback on the given reply.

In case of negative feedback, a **New feedback** window will also appear, where you can add a specific comment on why the answer was not relevant, accurate, or expected. This feedback is automatically sent to the admin interface after submission.

Thanks to this mechanism, administrators can monitor the quality of responses, analyze deficiencies in the data or context, and optimize assistant settings.

## Public Chat Plugin

A publicly accessible chat interface that can be easily embedded on a website (e.g., as an iframe or using a simple embed script). No registration or login is required. It allows visitors to communicate with AI assistants. The chat functionality matches the internal chat, with feedback and audit logging options.
