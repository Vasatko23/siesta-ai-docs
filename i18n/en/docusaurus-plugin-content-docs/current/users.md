# Users

This section is used for managing users within the Siesta AI platform. It is primarily intended for administrators, who can create new users, assign them roles, and set access levels to individual data sources and assistants.

## User Overview

Upon entering the Users section, you see a list of all users, including their name, e-mail, and assigned role (such as Admin or User). In the right column, you can view details of a specific user using the eye icon.

## Creating a New User

After clicking the **Add User** button, a form opens where the administrator enters:

- **Name**
- **E-mail**
- **Role** (e.g., Admin or User)

**Data Access**: you can choose either access to all data sources or limited access with the selection of specific assistants (e.g., "ESG Assistant" and "HR Assistant")

This allows you to precisely control which assistants a particular user can work with.

## User Management

Clicking on an existing user opens the detail, where you can:

- **edit the name, e-mail, or role**,
- **change access permissions to assistants** (again, full access or limited selection),
- **confirm and delete the user** (with a required deletion confirmation checkbox).

This granularity allows you to precisely set who can work with what, while maintaining control over sensitive data and assistants.
