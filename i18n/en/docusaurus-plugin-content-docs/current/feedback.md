# Feedback

The Feedback section is primarily intended for administrators to monitor and evaluate the quality of responses from individual AI assistants. It provides a quick overview of how users react to responses within conversations and give feedback.

## Feedback Overview

The main page displays a list of all feedbacks in the form of a table, where you can primarily see:

- **assistant name** to which the feedback relates,
- **user's e-mail** who submitted the feedback,
- **summary counts of positive and negative ratings** (thumbs up/down),
- **number of text comments** for specific responses.

Each record in the overview is interactive. By clicking the magnifying glass icon in the right column, the administrator can access the detailed view of the given feedback.

## Feedback and Comments Detail

After clicking on a specific assistant, a more detailed overview opens. It contains:

- **a list of individual responses** for which feedback was given,
- **submission date**, user name, and the assistant's message that was rated,
- **icons indicating the type of feedback**: thumbs up, thumbs down, comment.

Each response can be further opened in a separate detailed view, where you can see the entire conversation and the exact user comment for the given response. This allows the administrator to quickly understand where the answer might have been inaccurate, inappropriate, or unclear.

This section is an important tool for the continuous improvement of AI assistants. It provides the necessary data to adjust their settings, supplement the knowledge base, or rephrase instructions.
